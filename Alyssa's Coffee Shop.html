<p><b>Reason for the Change:</b><br> There was no explicit mention of positive comments in the initial set of
criteria for consumer feedback on menu variety and quality. Positive customer reviews are now
specifically included as a criterion in the updated chart, giving a clearer indicator of how well the new
menu items are received and accepted by customers.</p>

<img src="Screenshot 2023-12-17 164641.png" width="400" height="300"><br>


<p><b>Reason for the Change:</b><br> The initial criteria for staff training and adoption did not explicitly link staff
training to the successful integration of the POS system. The updated chart includes a clear connection
between staff training, technology adoption, and the overall success of the POS system integration,
providing a more comprehensive evaluation of this phase.</p>
